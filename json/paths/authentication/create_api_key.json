API keys can only be created once.\nTo rotate or update your API key, please refer to the Rotate Api Key endpoint.\nRotating an API key will revoke access from any API endpoints that are configured with any previously generated API key.\nUse this endpoint only if you feel that your API key has been exposed or compromised.\n",
